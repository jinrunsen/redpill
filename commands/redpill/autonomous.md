<objective>
Execute all remaining milestone phases autonomously. For each phase: discuss → plan → execute. Pauses only for user decisions (grey area acceptance, blockers, validation requests).

Uses ROADMAP.md phase discovery and Skill() flat invocations for each phase command. After all phases complete: milestone audit → complete → cleanup.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.redpill/STATE.md` — updated after each phase
- `.redpill/ROADMAP.md` — progress updated after each phase
- Phase artifacts — CONTEXT.md, PLANs, SUMMARYs per phase

**After:** Milestone is complete and cleaned up.

</execution_context>

<context>
Optional flags:
- `--from N` — start from phase N instead of the first incomplete phase.
- `--only N` — execute only phase N (single-phase mode).
- `--interactive` — run discuss inline with questions (not auto-answered), then dispatch plan→execute as background agents. Keeps the main context lean while preserving user input on decisions.

Project context, phase list, and state are resolved inside the workflow using init commands (`redpill-tools.cjs init milestone-op`, `redpill-tools.cjs roadmap analyze`). No upfront context loading needed.
</context>

<process>
Execute the autonomous workflow from @~/.claude/redpill/workflows/autonomous.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (phase discovery, per-phase execution, blocker handling, progress display).
</process>
